Teenage Art Scene is a Victoria based solo power-pop project led by Rupert Yakelashek which grinds glitchy, fuzzed-out lead guitars into hooky melodies, creating a distinct sonic palette adorned with slacker-rock vocals. Teenage Art Scene’s back-catalog extends back to 2019. The band’s progression is evident, with each self-released album entertaining a distinct sonic palette - from the blistering pop-punk riffs of Spill, to synth-pop forays on Pipes on the Inside, and the tape saturated crunch of Format Wars. Teenage Art Scene’s prolific discography and energetic live show have established them as an act to watch in the Canadian music scene.
